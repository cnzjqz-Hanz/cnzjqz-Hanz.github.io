<h2>More about me...</h2>
<p>
    - I'm a cinephile since high school. Movies have always been one of the best ways to find my inner peace, especially art house cinema. <a href="/my-cinematic-world/">See more</a> about my taste in movies.
</p>

<p>
    - I'm a regular book reader. I read a lot of books, mostly about philosophy, and literature. Often I'll take time to read when I'm overwhelmed with tasks as a way to maintain my state of focus. Or to escape reality when I'm in a bad mood. My favorite authors are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Carver">Raymond Carver</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoevsky">Fyodor Dostoyevskiy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus">Albert Camus</a>.

</p>

<p>
    - I have multiple preferences in music. Apart from pop music and hip-hop, I also enjoy post-punk, shoegaze, dream pop and indie rock music. My favorite bands are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Radio_Department">The Radio Dept.</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Bloody_Valentine_(band)">My Bloody Valentine</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_1975">The 1975</a>. <a href="/hello/">See more</a> about my music preference.
</p>

<p>
    - Definitely a sports fan, especially keen on soccer and tennis. Always a diehard fan of Barça and Dominic Thiem. I'm a former team leader of the CKC honors college soccer team, and also a member of the college tennis team, having won the 3rd place in Zhejiang University Intramural Tennis Team Competition.
